<h1>Neighbourhood Hunter</h1>

A web application that shows different Toronto neighbourhoods and indicates rent and house purchasing averages, crime rates, social activities, bars, coffee shops etc, so that newcomers as well as those who have lived in the city, can find an area of the city that suits their living tastes and needs. Users can log in and input their information that gets stored in a database through POST so they can retrieve their search at a later date.
